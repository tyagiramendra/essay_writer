How It Works:

Enter Your Topic: You start by typing your essay topic into a text box.
Generate Your Essay: When you click the “Generate” button, the AI begins creating a draft based on your topic.
Review and Revise: The draft is displayed in a text area where you can read it. If you want further improvements or additional content, you can click the “Next” button to move to the next step. The app then produces another version or adds more revisions.
Built with Streamlit:
The tool uses Streamlit, a popular framework for building interactive web apps with Python. This makes the app responsive and easy to use.

Interactive Feedback:
By allowing you to see each version of the essay and update it as needed, the app combines AI power with human feedback, ensuring the final essay meets your expectations.

In essence, this application simplifies essay writing by breaking it down into clear, manageable steps, using AI to generate content and letting you refine it until it’s just right.
